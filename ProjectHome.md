This repository contains a set of example map-reduces using Hadoop.

Specifically, there are examples for:
  * Pagerank
  * Canopy-clustering

These projects are both fairly rough around the edges, for which I apologize. They were written as proof-of-concepts for a cluster computing course at the University of Washington during Spring 2007.
